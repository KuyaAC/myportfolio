      "To further develop my backend programming skills, I created a To-Do List web application using Laravel. This application allows users to add, update, and delete tasks, with all data securely stored in a relational database. The front-end is designed using Bootstrap, providing a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface. This project helped me gain practical experience in building CRUD functionalities, managing database interactions, and applying modern design frameworks in a full-stack development environment.",

      "To improve my Python skills, I developed Space War, a two-player shooting game using Pygame. Each player controls a spaceship and battles by firing projectiles, with real-time movement, collision detection, and win conditions. This project helped reinforce my understanding of game logic and event handling in Python.",
